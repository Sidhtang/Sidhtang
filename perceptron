a preceptron is a type of artifical neuron used in supervised learning to classify input data into two parts 
The Perceptron
The Perceptron is one of the simplest ANN architectures, invented in 1957 by Frank
Rosenblatt. It is based on a slightly different artificial neuron (see Figure 10-4) called
a threshold logic unit (TLU), or sometimes a linear threshold unit (LTU). The inputs
and output are numbers (instead of binary on/off values), and each input connection
is associated with a weight
